# A compiler from PL/B-3 to Brainf--k 

This is an unrefined collection of experimental code related to PL/B-3 project:
a proto-compiler to Brainf--k. This is not a proper compiler, but
rather a testbed for various techniques and styles which are
too questionable to be used in actual production code.
